**WATERFRONT KITCHEN AND BATH**is owned and operated by Northern Plumbing Supply, a wholesale plumbing & heating supplier located in Grand Forks and Fargo, ND. NPS began as a division of The Goodman Company, a chain of seven "farm electric" stores started by Dewey Goodman in the 1930's. When Dewey Goodman died unexpectantly in 1950, his sons Gene and Chuck took over, and in the early 1950's split it into two businesses; Goodman Furniture & Appliance and Northern Plumbing Supply.

Today, NPS is owned and operated by Gene's sons Ron and Barry. In June 2005, Ron's son Brian became the 4th generation to work in the family business. The Fargo branch opened in February 2003 and Northern Plumbing Supply, Inc celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2004\.

Our plumbing showrooms, Waterfront Kitchen and Bath, located at 2 S 3rd Street in Grand Forks and 1817 Great Northern Drive in Fargo, are full of beautiful displays featuring name brand products including kitchen sinks and faucets, whirlpool tubs, bathroom lavatories and toilets, and more. We are told they are the best showrooms from Minneapolis to the West Coast.

Waterfront Kitchen & Bath and Northern Plumbing Supply promote the services of licensed professional Plumbing and Heating contractors. Please visit our[Find a Plumber][0]page for names and locations of our contractor customer network.
